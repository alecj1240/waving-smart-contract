## WAVE PORTAL

Send me a message over the Ethereum blockchain. 

This hasn't been deployed to mainnet, and is instead running on the developer/test chain, rinkeby. 

The smart contract also pays you a small amount of Ethereum when you send me a message.

## Smart Contract

This app does require you have a smart contract deployed to use. 

I built it using Buildspace's tutorials which uses hardhat to help create the smart contract. 

## Moving to Replit

In lieu of Replit's awesome new solidity template, going to be moving all of this over to Replit and improving it!
